# Project Euler Solutions

This is a repo where I store my Python solutions to problems on 
<https://projecteuler.net>.

The answers I uploaded all yielded the right solutions, but there
is no guarantee that they are the most succinct or the smartest 
(in fact, I am sure almost all, if not actually all, of them are
not, but they worked :P ). Nevertheless, I hope that they are 
readable and easy enough to help those who are a bit confused about 
how to approach some of the problems. At the same time, I am happy 
to discuss the problems and solutions with others and learn from 
the amazing Project Euler community.
