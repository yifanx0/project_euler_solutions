# Project Euler Solutions

This is a repo where I store my Python solutions to problems on 
<https://projecteuler.net>.

I recently noticed that the Project Euler website says 
users are not supposed to share answers on public repos. But since 
I am using this repo mostly for keeping track of my own progress, I 
would like to keep it this way. 

It would be great if you only check out my solutions after you have 
solved the problem yourself. Do not give up the challenge and more 
importantly the FUN :P
